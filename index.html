      <p class= "ourjourney">The day we started this journey with our newfound enthusiasm and determination to do something, to make a change was the day it all changed. We were just regular kids who have complaints. Ok, a lot of complaints. But soon we realised that we needed to solve our problems instead of pointing them out and waiting for someone else to jump in. We need to make the change we wanted to see. 
        The day we started this journey with our newfound enthusiasm and determination to do something, to make a change was the day it all changed. We were just regular kids who have complaints. Ok, a lot of complaints. But soon we realised that we needed to solve our problems instead of pointing them out and waiting for someone else to jump in.
        We need to make the change we wanted to see. Better yet, we had to become the change we wanted to see. We formed a group of like-minded, stubborn kids like us and named us Khusshi. Little did we know that we would form a family tied together with strong bonds with some loose edges. We did our first official event on 14th November, Children's' Day. We distributed food to children. We were nervous, we were scared. But we pulled it off. Most of all, we made them smile. Seeing those smile, the kind that reaches your eyes, made us a little less helpless. It almost made us feel like we were superheroes. We had our fair share of hardships and we almost even reached the dead-end. Sometimes we lost all hope. But there's this one thing that kept us going no matter what. Determination. Sheer determination with a sprinkle of stubbornness was all it took to keep on going with slow steady steps. Now we've benefitted over 1000 children and more than 50 families, we know where we belong. We finally know who we are. We are Garia Khusshi Welfare Society. We'll always be Garia Khusshi Welfare Society.

     <h2 class="aboutushead">ABOUT US</h2>
     <P class="aboutus">
       Khusshi is an NGO who actively operates and micromanage events within the firmaments and radium of India to make victuals and prerequisites to survive. This organisation has reached even to the sequestered places where no other organisations could reach. We as a young NGO have benefitted over 1000+ children and 50+ families in this small timescale. This NGO is run by some very enthusiastic youth who believe that if we want to bring change then we will have to work for it. They inspire the young generation to step forward and be the change they want to bring and proffer their services to society.
       All we spend a lump sum amount of money on certain useless needs. Lets us invest that money and turn that baseless and useless need to basic necessities and bring a smile to the poor. Let us come forward and turn those frowns upside down and help inspire more number of youth in our society.
